# In pure Vanilla Javascript: AI voice chat with a distinct personality as game master, storytelling, etc.

## Core idea: Use an AI voice chat with a distinct personality as a game master for outdoor escape games, storytelling or child-safe apps.

For this I built a Proof-of-Concept:

## 🚀 What’s Different?

Most voice bots are monolithic and hard to embed. This PoC focuses on a lightweight, modular approach:

- Hands-free interaction: Fully web-embedded voice-to-voice flow.
- Separation of concerns: Strict split between UI, logic, and the "persona."
- Role-driven: Built specifically for narrators, GMs, or expert guides.

### 🛠 The Tech & State
It’s an early-stage, experimental project. I’ve focused on making it modular and documented so others can actually understand what’s happening under the hood. No pitch deck, no hype—just a working prototype that would be happy to get some feedback.

### 🎄 Use Case Example: The AI Elf
One direction I’m exploring in the docs: A child-friendly companion app. Voice-based, story-driven, and designed to be emotionally safe for kids.

## 🤝 Looking for collaborators
I’m looking for early collaborators to discuss the architecture and potential. Ideally based in Southern Germany / EU (for timezone and meet-up reasons), but open to everyone.

This isn't a job offer. It’s a “let’s see if we can turn this into something bigger” call.
Check out the demo and let me know what you think!
