A browser-based, voice-only "Personality" framework for "zero-install" in pure Vanilla JS


*** Body***


I've been working on a small framework to build AI "personalities" that you can interact with purely through voice in the browser. The idea is to have hands-free guides for things like escape rooms or storytelling without needing to download an app.

It’s built with Vanilla JS and connects to an LLM backend. I currently have a few test characters (like a forest elf for kids) as a Proof-of-concept.

I would love to connect with anyone working on similar "personality-driven", "No-install, no-login, just-run" projects.

I’ve been working on a side project to tackle "App Fatigue" in niche scenarios like escape rooms, guided tours, or storytelling. The goal was to create an immersive, voice-to-voice experience that requires no app download, no login, and no tracking.

The Concept: It’s a lightweight pure-web framework that wraps LLMs into specific "Live Personalities." Unlike a standard chatbot, these are designed for hands-free, eyes-off interaction.

I created some test characters in Englisch and German: a forest elf, a grumpy salesman and an Alpine landlady.

The project focuses on an easy-2-use framework in pure Vanilla JS, until now it is a Proof-of-Concept and might be helpful to others too.

I'm a dev based in Southern Germany and would love to hear from anyone working on similar "personality-driven" AI or voice interfaces. The PoC is live and free to use.

Greetings, Jo

Thanks for the interest! Here is the live PoC: https://joembedded.de/x3/minichat/sw/launch.html

I’m particularly curious about how it handles your accent or if you notice any lag in the voice processing. It’s all running through the browser API, so no install needed."
