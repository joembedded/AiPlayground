# Not an App to be installed, just a pure Website "with distinct personality"
AI voice chat as game master, for storytelling and experienced guide through this-and-that


## Core idea and Proof-of-Concept
Often there are situations, where it would be helpfull to have some kind of reliable guide, game master or expert. Like for adventures or escape or narrative games, for "living stories" or just "someone", you could ask quickly dedicated expert question, that are too specific to find it in the Internet.

But you don't want to install an app for everyting! So, why not equip a pure and simple webpage with an personality, like some kind of oldstyle chatbots. But due to AI, much, much smarter.

And you can talk with it by natural voice! Wich makes it very convenient, much more convenient than just chatting text.
And it has a "personality": E.g. for children safe replies or as your technical expert about a special datasheet or manual. 
And you have your hands free, all the time!

## My Proof-of-Concept
For this I built a Proof-of-Concept (German and English and others)
Using an standard AI layer with a lightwight own framework to build some "Personalities", e.g. - Jack, the anoyed car salesman, - Velo, the forrest elf or - Jana the Alpine Landlady. All are specialized to a specific personality. It works great!

[📘🔗 Live Demo](https://joembedded.de/x3/minichat/sw/launch.html) : If anybody is interested, just let me know and I post the links. My PoC implementation is completely free and does not require any installations or loggins. Just works.

### 🛠 The Tech & State
This is no pitch deck, just a working prototype that would be happy to get some feedback.

### 🎄 Use Case Example: Vilo - the Elf in the Black Forrest - Just talk to it, and the story awakes to live!
One direction I’m exploring in the docs: A child-friendly companion a webpage. Voice-based, story-driven, and designed to be emotionally safe for kids. E.g. for child suited adventure games in the nature

## 🤝 Sounds interesting?
I would be happy to discuss with others (technical, artistical, or just cuirous) to find out "if we can turn this into something bigger”
Ideally based in Southern Germany / DE / EU, but open to everyone.

Greetings, Jo 🙂
